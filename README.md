# 🦅 avian-ai-lab  
**A personal research lab exploring machine learning for birds, ecology, and conservation.**

This repository is where I develop hands-on projects, experiments, and reading notes at the intersection of:

- bird detection and species classification  
- drone and aerial imagery  
- data science for conservation  
- ecological machine learning  
- biodiversity monitoring  

My goal is to build a focused, practical portfolio demonstrating how ML can support real-world ecological questions — starting with bird detection pipelines and expanding into multi-species classification, density estimation, and habitat-specific model evaluation.

## 📝 Paper Reading Notes  
Located in: `/docs/papers_read/`

This section captures my structured notes as I read key papers in ecological ML — helping me think critically, understand context, and build intuition before coding.

Papers include:
- *Automated Detection of Salvin’s Albatrosses (2025)*  
- More to come as I read page-by-page every week.

## 🎯 Current Focus  
- Understanding drone-based bird detection  
- Learning about dataset design, annotation noise, and domain shift  
- Replicating a detection + SAHI + fine-tuning pipeline  
- Exploring species classification for aerial imagery  
- Building a clean, extensible research structure

## 🧡 Why This Lab Exists  
I want to contribute to the future of conservation technology — particularly in ornithology — by combining my background in data science with the ecological tools used in field research.

This repo is my journey toward that goal.

## 🌱 Future Directions  
- Drone-based seabird species classification  
- Count models (density estimation)  
- Multi-species detection pipelines  
- Chile-focused datasets  
- Technical explainers and visual guides
